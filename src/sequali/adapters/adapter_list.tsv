# This file contains subsequences of common adapters
# Keep in mind that the implementation stores adapters in a 64-bit word so
# the runtime increases when the combined length of the adapters exceeds
# 64. For this reason length 12 is chosen, so we can fit 5 adapters in a
# single word.

# Many of the nanopore sequences share subsequences. Below sequences where chosen
# for uniqueness in the nanopore set as well as for not occurring much in the human 
# genome. Sequences are expected to occur one in ~1.6 million (4^12) times. A few times
# higher than that is acceptable (because it is still rare), but not much. Sequences 
# with TTTTTTT or AAAAAA for instance  occur much more frequently. (Hundres to thousands of times).
