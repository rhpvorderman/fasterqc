# This file contains subsequences of common adapters
# Keep in mind that the implementation stores adapters in a 64-bit word so
# the runtime increases when the combined length of the adapters exceeds
# 64. For this reason length 12 is chosen, so we can fit 5 adapters in a
# single word.

# Nanopore sequences can be found by reading through the documentation here:
# https://help.nanoporetech.com/en/articles/6632917-what-are-the-adapter-sequences-used-in-the-kits
# Many of the nanopore sequences share subsequences. Below sequences where chosen
# for uniqueness in the nanopore set as well as for not occurring much in the human 
# genome. Sequences are expected to occur one in ~1.6 million (4^12) times. For
# a total of 179 times in a 3,000,000,000 bp human genome.
# A few times higher than that is acceptable (because it is still rare), but
# not much. Sequences with TTTTTTT or AAAAAA for instance  occur much more
#frequently. (Hundres to thousands of times).

# Since nanopore sequences are notoriously unreliable at the ends, adapter
# probe sequences must be preferably as for away from the extremes as possible.
# Since nanopore more often has deletions and insertions, a 12 bp probe with 0
# errors, a little away from the read beginning or end, is the most cost
# effective way for searching adapters. Fuzzy matching algorithms are more
# expensive. See https://github.com/rhpvorderman/sequali/issues/69
