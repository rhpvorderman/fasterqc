This folder contains sequences that are often found as contaminants in
sequencing experiments. According to the NCBI the most common contaminations
are:
- Vector DNA (plasmid, phage, BAC, etc.)
- Adapters, linkers and PCR primers
Other sources of contaminations are:
- Transposons and insertion sequences
- DNA impurities

NCBI keeps a database called UniVec for vectors and updated. It was last
updated on May 5th 2017. It can be downloaded from:
https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/UniVec

The UniVec database contains many adapters, linkers, and primers but not yet
a lot of those that are used in Oxford nanopore sequencing. The
oxford_nanopore.fasta file provides the sequences as represented in the
technical documentation. All possible barcoding sequencing adapters for
nanopore have not yet been added.
